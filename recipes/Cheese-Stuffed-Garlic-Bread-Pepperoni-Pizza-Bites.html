  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This is something I saw on Youtube Shorts that looks good</p>

  <h3>Recipe</h3>

    <li>1 Roll of premade Pillsbury flaky layers biscuits</li>
    <li>1 package of Pepperoni</li>
    <li>1 block of Swiss cheese</li>
    <li>1 block of mild cheddar cheese </li>
    <li>3 TBSP butter (will need some extra)</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>

  <ol>

    <li>Gently spread the biscuit dough by hand</li>
    <li>Once spread, fill the biscuit with all three ingredients </li>
    <li>Seal the biscuit into a ball, making sure to properly seal the inside to avoid leaking ingredients during baking</li>
    <li>Rub some butter on the baking dish to avoid sticking (use extra)</li>
    <li>Crack 1 egg into bowl, whisk, and brush over top of uncooked biscuits </li>
    <li>Bake biscuits in oven at 350° for 12-15 minutes (larger biscuits will likely take around 18 minutes)</li>
